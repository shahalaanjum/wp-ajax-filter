With This plugin you can easily create a Ajax Search and Filter For Custom Posts and Any Custom Taxonomy, once you install and activate the plugin, you can use the below Shortcode to display the filter and posts.

Display Default posts with category filter : 

[ajax_posts_filter]

Display any custom posts types with any custom taxonomy with attributes as follows: 

[ajax_posts_filter postype="YOUR_CPT_NAME" taxtype="YOUR_TAXONOMY_NAME"]

Please modify the taxonomy in the code accordingly (since currently it has been set to filter for tag and category only)
